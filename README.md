Important Updates

We value your trust in choosing us as your VPN provider, thus we are working hard to make sure all users share the server and network resources fairly. Illegal BitTorrent has been eating up most of resources while others suffer longer latency and lower bandwidth. As such some key servers have been explicitly marked as 'No P2P'. Unfortunately, a small number of bitTorrent users have chosen to ignore, hence we are introducing a limited logging policy: All Torrent traffic will be logged.

### Error Data

We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a case of an error in the app, the error information (through Google Firebase) is collected (i.e. error code, error reason, etc) from te App. This data will only be used to identy App issues, and will NEVER to be used to identify yourself or your device.
